This is a plugin to log mysql connections and disconnections of SOME users (blacklist or whitelist, it's up to you).
It can also log every (successful or not) query typed for those users.

Typical usage: track human activities on the database without polluting log or degrading performance for non-human users.

How can it distinguish humans from non-humans? You should put in a file a list of human users OR a list of non-human users. See example.conf (to be appended in my.cnf)

It requires MySQL or MariaDB (tested on MariaDB) at least v5.5 because it's an AUDIT plugin. (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/audit-plugins.html)
